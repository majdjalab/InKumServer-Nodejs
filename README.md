## Technologies Used

1. User Authentication: InKumServer includes a robust user authentication system that allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their authentication tokens. It provides features such as password hashing and token-based authentication for enhanced security.

2. Real Estate Listings API: InKumServer exposes APIs for retrieving real estate listings. It handles requests for fetching listings based on location, price range, property type, and other relevant criteria. The backend retrieves the necessary data from the database and sends it to the frontend for display.

3. Create and Manage Listings: InKumServer allows authenticated users to create new real estate listings by providing relevant details such as title, description, images, location, and price. It validates the input and stores the listing information in the database, making it accessible to other users.

4. User Posts API: InKumServer provides APIs for creating and retrieving user posts related to real estate. Users can create posts with valuable insights, tips, or news. The backend stores the posts in the database and sends them to the frontend for display in the dedicated posts section.

5. Secure API Endpoints: InKumServer ensures that the API endpoints are secure by implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. It validates user tokens and authorizes access to protected routes, maintaining the privacy and integrity of user data.
